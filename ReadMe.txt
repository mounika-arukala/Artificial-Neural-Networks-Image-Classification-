Uncommented code:
TestNet fun implementation- This function has got two parameters, the first being the path where the model is residing and the second being the test_images path.

You can run the file that I have submitted directly, by changing the two parameters of the function with the respective paths.

In the commented code:
Take triple quotes(""") off which gives a block of code I have used to train the given data and to evaluate the accuracy of the testing data where the accuracy is 97.87%. My NN classifies 78.71747211895911% of bee images as bees and 99.12607712522153% of bee images as no bees.
